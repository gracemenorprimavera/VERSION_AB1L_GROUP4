Inventory System for Burger Stalls
Description
             An Inventory System is an automated system that keeps track of inventory on a regular basis. It also ensures that items marked for inventory and distribution are accounted for to keep an audit trail of all transactions. 
          Basically, an inventory system tracks products, cost and profits of a company. Users may be an employee in shift or the manager/owner for full control. It will help an employee and business owners to manage their transactions like listing of available items, sold items and computing the profit of the business. 
         This system is intended for burger stalls like Angel’s Burger, Minute Burger and the like. It will record the delivered items like buns, hamburgers, ketchup, mayonnaise and products related to the burger establishment. At the same time, it will also record the sold items upon purchase of the customer.
Goals
	Through this project, we want to achieve a reliable and accurate inventory system that will help the business owners and employees to lighten their loads and tasks to compute their inventory at minimal time and lesser error exerting only minimum effort.
